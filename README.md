# HR_Database_Testing_Project
In this HR Database Testing Project,I created and tested an HR Management System database using MySQL.
The main goal was to validate data, check relationships, and perform business rule testing.
This project simulates an HR system containing tables for:
Employees
Departments
Job Roles
Salaries
Performance
**Key SQL Queries & Their Purpose**
✅ Employee full name, department, and job role – tested join accuracy.
✅ Converted hire date from text to date format – validated data type.
✅ Found employees hired in the last 1 year – used date functions.
✅ Listed employees without managers – checked missing data.
✅ Filtered high-salary employees (> ₹80,000) – tested filtering logic.
✅ Counted employees per department – verified grouping logic.
✅ Calculated average age per department – tested aggregation
✅ Found department with highest salary total – used SUM() and ORDER BY
✅ Listed excellent performers by department – validated performance data

✅ Calculated department-wise average performance score – used CASE and AVG()
